# C++ bindings for the Senaps Web API

These are web bindings for the [Senaps (formerly known as SensorCloud)](https://research.csiro.au/dss/research/sensor-data-models-managament/), derived from the [JSON openapi specs for the data provision](https://sensor-cloud.io/api-docs/sensorcloud-spec.json). Note that there are specifications for a modelling part too, as yet not within scope for senaps-cpp.

As of Nov 2017 two drivers for this work:

* Me getting hands on with OpenAPI specs and tooling
* Exploring using Senaps as a point time series back-end storage for [A C++ software stack for ensemble forecasting](https://www.mssanz.org.au/modsim2015/L15/perraud.pdf)

This is "skunk" work on the side though, for now.
